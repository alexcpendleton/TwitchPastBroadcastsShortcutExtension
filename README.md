# Twitch Past Broadcasts Shortcut Extension
Adds a link on a Twitch channel to quickly get to that broadcaster's past broadcasts.

Has localization support for all languages Twitch supports. However, your system must be using the locale, not just your Twitch settings. I was unable to test all of these localizations, so if you find issues please let me know.
